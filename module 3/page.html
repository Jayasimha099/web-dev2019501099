	<h1>My Experiences in MSIT</h1>
</div>

	<p>Firstly, after knowing the syllabus and work culture in MSIT course, I have thought that my career can be improved by studying here. Later on, the principle "LEARNING  BY DOING" followed in MSIT has encouraged my way of learning. In addition, mentors and programming coaches in this course are very helpful in teaching and they are student-friendly</p>

	<p>I have learned and improved my career by learning these subjects</p>
